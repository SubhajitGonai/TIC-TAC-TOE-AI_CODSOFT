# TIC-TAC-TOE-AI_CODSOFT
TIC-TAC-TOE_AI_CODSOFT is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI agent plays against a human player. The AI uses algorithms like Minimax (with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning) to ensure it is unbeatable. This project demonstrates the application of game theory and basic search algorithms.
